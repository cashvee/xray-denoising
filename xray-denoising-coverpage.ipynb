Denoising is often required for proper diagnostic analysis by medical professionals.  Competent denoising software exist on the market, but there is still research interest due to: \n",

The middle column are noisy versions of the x-rays.  The right column are denoised x-ray images (denoised by a denoising autoencoder).  The image in the middle column would be inputs to your model and the right column are the outputs.  The left column represent the ideal output.  \n",
